    <p>This Apache web server container was created by an <strong>Ansible playbook</strong>, and uses a persistent volume backed by <strong>NetApp</strong> using <strong>Trident</strong>.</p>
    <p>Trident is a fully supported open source project maintained by <a href="http://www.netapp.com"">NetApp</a>. It has been designed from the ground up to help you meet the sophisticated persistence demands of your containerized applications.</p>
    <p>Through its support for popular container platforms like <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, Trident understands the natural and evolving languages of those platforms, and translates requirements expressed or implied through them into an automated and orchestrated response from the infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Today, that infrastructure includes our <a href="https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/ontap.aspx">ONTAP</a> (AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud), <a href="https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/element-os.aspx">Element</a> (HCI/SolidFire), and <a href="https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/santricity-os.aspx">SANtricity</a> (E/EF-Series) data management software, as well as the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/netapp/">Azure NetApp Files</a> service and the <a href="https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-aws?utm_source=GitHub&utm_campaign=Trident">Cloud Volumes Service on AWS</a>.</p>
    <p>That list continues to grow.</p>
